# BusinessIntelligenceAnalysis_RestaurantLocations_and_MenuPrices
This repository contains custom SQL queries I wrote to answer complex BIA questions. 
There are 2 databases here as well, which contain details on 19,439 restaurants and similar businesses with menu items containing "burrito" or "taco" in their names (data provided byÂ Datafiniti's Business Database). 

The questions my SQL queries are answering can be found below:

1) Which restaurants that have both burritos and tacos on the menu have the most locations?
2) Which cities have the greatest number of authentic Mexican restaurants?
3) What is the ratio of burritos to tacos on restaurant menus from each city?  Sort by largest ratio to smallest.
