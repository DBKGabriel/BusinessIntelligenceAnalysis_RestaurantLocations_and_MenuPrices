# BusinessIntelligenceAnalysis_RestaurantLocations_and_MenuPrices
This repository contains custom SQL queries I wrote to answer complex BIA questions, the databases those queries reference, and a report I wrote sumarrizing my findings. 

Questions 1-3 relied on data from 2 databases, which contained details on 19,439 restaurants and similar businesses with menu items containing "burrito" or "taco" in their names (data provided by Datafiniti's Business Database). 

Another database was used to provide answers to a 4th question. The database "taco_truck_sales" contains data related to Taco Cat Spelled Backwards Food Truck's taco sales from 2021 - 2022.

The questions my SQL queries are answering can be found below:

1) Which restaurants that have both burritos and tacos on the menu have the most locations?
2) Which cities have the greatest number of authentic Mexican restaurants?
3) What is the ratio of burritos to tacos on restaurant menus from each city?  Sort by largest ratio to smallest.
4) Calculate the monthly revenue earned per taco for tacos made with chicken protein by spice level over time.
